# portfolio_page
Actual working version of Udacity portfolio project.

This was a portfolio project created for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The CSS and JS are powered largely by Bootstrap, with a few extra styling elements for customization and better responsivity.
This page will ultimately be updated with future completed projects, but for now it's full of silly pictures.
